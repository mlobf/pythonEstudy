"""
I will write a program to print a number of options and allow the user to select
     an option from the list. The options shoud be list from one to nine. The 
     program should be looping. The loop should terminate when the user choose 0.
     If the user makes a valid choise, the program should print a short message.
     The message should include the value that they typed.
     Dont printed a different message for each choise, the only change should
     be the number that they typed.
     If the user choose an wrong option, the program must be printed again.
